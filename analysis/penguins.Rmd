```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Penguin analysis

```{r libraries}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Do stuff

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  count(species)

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm , y= bill_depth_mm, col = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
